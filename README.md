This project is a GUI-based file encryption and decryption tool developed in MATLAB, 
supporting multiple cryptographic algorithms including AES, DES, and RC4. 
The application allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text files through an intuitive graphical interface.

Users can select a text file, choose the desired encryption method, 
and then perform encryption or decryption operations seamlessly. 
The encrypted or decrypted content is saved as a new file, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. 
The project highlights a strong understanding of cryptographic standards and GUI development in MATLAB, 
with practical implementation of file I/O, algorithm selection, and user-friendly interaction.

This tool demonstrates applied knowledge in cybersecurity, data protection, and software development within a MATLAB environment.
