This project involved developing a custom MATLAB script that implements the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) 
algorithm to provide secure encryption and decryption of text files. The script reads plain text files, 
encrypts their content using AES encryption, and then writes the encrypted data to a new file. 
It also includes functionality to decrypt encrypted files back into readable plain text.

The primary goal of the project was to explore the application of cryptographic principles 
using MATLAB and demonstrate how file-based data can be securely handled using symmetric encryption techniques. 
This project showcases skills in cryptography, file handling, and algorithmic implementation within MATLAB.
